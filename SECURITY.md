# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security problems privately, never in a public issue or pull request:

- e-mail **security@openbrandexchange.com**, or
- open a private report under **Security → Report a vulnerability** on this GitHub repository.

Include what you found, the affected version or commit (`GET /readyz` does not show it; the admin
shows it under Settings, and `/metrics` reports `obx_build_info`), the steps to reproduce it and
the impact you expect. Please do not access data that is not yours, and give us time to fix the
problem before you disclose it.

## What happens next

| When | What we do |
|---|---|
| within 3 working days | confirm that we received the report |
| within 10 working days | tell you whether we can reproduce it and how serious we think it is |
| within 90 days (sooner for critical issues) | release a fix and publish an advisory, crediting you if you wish |

We coordinate the date of public disclosure with you. There is no bug bounty.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are made for the latest minor release (0.1.x today). Brands running their own portal
should update when a release says it contains a security fix (see docs/upgrading.md).

## Scope

This repository: the portal code, the Docker image, the release files and the deployment templates.
Problems in the protocol itself go to the spec repository's private reporting in the same way;
problems in the admin screens to the admin-ui repository. When in doubt, e-mail us and we route it.

How the portal protects data is described in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).
